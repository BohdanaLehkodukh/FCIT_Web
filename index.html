      Why are people more relaxed in green rooms? Why do weightlifters do their
      best in blue gyms?

      Colors often have different meanings in various cultures. And even in
      Western societies, the meanings of various colors have changed over the
      years. But today in the U.S., researchers have generally found the
      following to be accurate.
    </p>
    <div id="l1"><h2>Black</h2></div>
    <p>
      Black is the color of authority and power. It is popular in fashion
      because it makes people appear thinner. It is also stylish and timeless.
      Black also implies submission. Priests wear black to signify submission to
      God. Some fashion experts say a woman wearing black implies submission to
      men. Black outfits can also be overpowering, or make the wearer seem aloof
      or evil. Villains, such as Dracula, often wear black.
    </p>
    <div id="l2"><h2>White</h2></div>
    <p>
      Brides wear white to symbolize innocence and purity. White reflects light
      and is considered a summer color. White is popular in decorating and in
      fashion because it is light, neutral, and goes with everything. However,
      white shows dirt and is therefore more difficult to keep clean than other
      colors. Doctors and nurses wear white to imply sterility.
    </p>
    <div id="l3"><h2>Red</h2></div>
    <div id="l4">
      <p>
        The most emotionally intense color, red stimulates a faster heartbeat
        and breathing. It is also the color of love. Red clothing gets noticed
        and makes the wearer appear heavier. Since it is an extreme color, red
        clothing might not help people in negotiations or confrontations. Red
        cars are popular targets for thieves. In decorating, red is usually used
        as an accent. Decorators say that red furniture should be perfect since
        it will attract attention.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="l5">
      <p>
        The most romantic color, pink, is more tranquilizing. Sports teams
        sometimes paint the locker rooms used by opposing teams bright pink so
        their opponents will lose energy.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="l6"><h2>Blue</h2></div>
    <div id="l7">
      <p>
        The color of the sky and the ocean, blue is one of the most popular
        colors. It causes the opposite reaction as red. Peaceful, tranquil blue
        causes the body to produce calming chemicals, so it is often used in
        bedrooms. Blue can also be cold and depressing. Fashion consultants
        recommend wearing blue to job interviews because it symbolizes loyalty.
        People are more productive in blue rooms. Studies show weightlifters are
        able to handle heavier weights in blue gyms.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="l8"><h2>Green</h2></div>
    <div id="l9">
      <p>
        Currently the most popular decorating color, green symbolizes nature. It
        is the easiest color on the eye and can improve vision. It is a calming,
        refreshing color. People waiting to appear on TV sit in "green rooms" to
        relax. Hospitals often use green because it relaxes patients. Brides in
        the Middle Ages wore green to symbolize fertility. Dark green is
        masculine, conservative, and implies wealth. However, seamstresses often
        refuse to use green thread on the eve of a fashion show for fear it will
        bring bad luck.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="l10"><h2>Yellow</h2></div>
    <div id="l11">
      <p>
        Cheerful sunny yellow is an attention getter. While it is considered an
        optimistic color, people lose their tempers more often in yellow rooms,
        and babies will cry more. It is the most difficult color for the eye to
        take in, so it can be overpowering if overused. Yellow enhances
        concentration, hence its use for legal pads. It also speeds metabolism.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="l12"><h2>Purple</h2></div>
    <div id="l13">
      <p>
        The color of royalty, purple connotes luxury, wealth, and
        sophistication. It is also feminine and romantic. However, because it is
        rare in nature, purple can appear artificial.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="l14"><h2>Brown</h2></div>
    <div id="l15">
      <p>
        Solid, reliable brown is the color of earth and is abundant in nature.
        Light brown implies genuineness while dark brown is similar to wood or
        leather. Brown can also be sad and wistful. Men are more apt to say
        brown is one of their favorite colors.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Food for Thought</h2>
    <p>
      While blue is one of the most popular colors it is one of the least
      appetizing. Blue food is rare in nature. Food researchers say that when
      humans searched for food, they learned to avoid toxic or spoiled objects,
      which were often blue, black, or purple. When food dyed blue is served to
      study subjects, they lose appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Green, brown, and red are the most popular food colors. Red is often used
      in restaurant decorating schemes because it is an appetite stimulant.
